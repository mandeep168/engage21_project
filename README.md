## Technologies used
<b>socket.io</b><br>
Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.
<br>

<b>peerjs</b><br>
PeerJS takes the implementation of WebRTC in your browser and wraps a simple, consistent, and elegant API around it. It is used for setting up the video and data connection
<br>

<b>Nodejs</b><br>
Nodejs is used for creating backend APIs
<br>

<b>Express</b><br>
For writing the logic in backend
<br>

<b>uuid</b><br>
For generating dynamic room ids
<br>

<b>mongoose</b><br>
Used for connecting application to mongodb cluster for storing messages
<br>

<b>cors</b><br>
“CORS” stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows you to make requests from one website to another website in the browser, which is normally prohibited by another browser policy<br>

For icons I have used www.fontawesome.com
